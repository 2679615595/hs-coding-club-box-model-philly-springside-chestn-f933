# Box Model

The box model is a fundamental concept of CSS that determines a site layout and will dictate how the browser sizes our elements on the page. Every single HTML element (or piece of content) is viewed as a box with a width, height, padding (spacing inside), margin (spacing outside), and a border.


## How It Works

Take a look at the image below to get a sense of how these properties come to play. The blue background is considered the content that you're styling. 

+ `Margin` is the spacing between the element you're styling and other elements (top, right, bottom, and left)

+ `Border` is a decorative border around the element you're styling (top, right, bottom, and left)

+ `Padding` is spacing between the element itself and the border (top, right, bottom, and left)
